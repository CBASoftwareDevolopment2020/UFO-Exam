\section{Conclusion}
YOLO is by far the fastest of the different algorithms we tested. So if speed is the primary factor YOLO would be a great choice. HOG is both slower and less precise, it is better for finding shapes, but because people can have different stances and angles, it makes it very difficult for this approach.
Faster R-CNN was the only algorithm that found all the people in the pictures, but it did however also have a false-positive. So if speed is not an issue and completeness is the most important thing, Faster R-CNN is a great choice.\\
Overall for tracking people in a stream of images, we found that YOLOâ€™s speed and accuracy was the best fit, as it didn't have any false positives, and also was on average 6 times faster than Faster R-CNN. This makes YOLO soundness, from our experiment.
