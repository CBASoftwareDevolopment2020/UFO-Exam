\noindent Detecting people in a video in real time requires you to run an object detection algorithm on different images multiple times a second. This article provides a comparison of three different object detection algorithms, comparing speed and accuracy. Our testing shows that YOLO is the best of the chosen algorithms, when looking at accuracy and the tests show that it is on average 6 times faster. Using YOLO makes real time object detection in a video possible without losing frames per second.
