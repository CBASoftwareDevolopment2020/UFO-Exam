\noindent In this paper, we compare three different ways of detecting people on an image. The goal is to find the fastest and most precise algorithm to be able to track people in a real time image stream. YOLO is on average 6 times faster than Faster R-CNN. Using YOLO instead of Faster R-CNN will increase the amount images you can process each second and improve tracking performance.
