\section{Discussion and Future Work}
The current code is run on the CPU, in the future it could be interesting to run some of these algorithms on a dedicated graphics card, for example you can use a newer nVidia card with integrated CUDA cores to speed up the processing time by as much as 10times????

Some of the different techniques these selected algorithms can be run using other weights that can make them faster, but less precise.
